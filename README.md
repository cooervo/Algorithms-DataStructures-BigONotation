# Algorithms DataStructures BigONotation

Live demo: https://cooervo.github.io/Algorithms-DataStructures-BigONotation/

This is a simple website I made as a fun project to help me better understand algorithms, data structures and Big O notation. And also to have some practice in Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Responsive Web Design (RWD).

If you discover some errors in the code or typos I haven't noticed please just let me know or feel free to contribute with Github, fork the project and make a pull request :)

Sections are divided into:

- Big O cheatsheets
- Intro
- Big O notation
- Data structures
- Algorithms

## Technologies or guidelines

This website uses the following technologies to work properly:

* JS & jQuery for interactivity
* jQuery `tablesorter` unofficial fork https://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/
* CSS + HTML for structure and styling
* Responsive Web Design (RWD) to adjust to desktop and smartphones
* Git for VCS
